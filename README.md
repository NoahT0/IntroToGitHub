# IntroToGitHub
Version Control is a way to save different versions of your code throughout development. This is helpful if you ever need to revert back to a different version of the project if there is a problem in the current version.

## Description

### Week 6
The first week of this intro project I created a GitHub account and a new repository called IntroToGitHub

### Week 7
The second week I installed Git and created a new local repository. I also tested some of the basic commands like push, add and commit

### Week 8
The third week I learned about SSH keys and created one. I then pushed a change using SSH.

### Week 9
The fourth week I learned about pull requests. I then created an issue on the main branch and had it fixed in a different branch. I then used a pull request to address the issue on the main branch

### Week 10
The fifth week I learned about markdown files. I am currently working with it as I type this README.
